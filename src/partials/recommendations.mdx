	teaching English in Japan.

# Fiction
- [The Sacrifices Arc](http://lightning.ffstories.net/fanfiction.php) by Lightning on the 
Wave is a Slytherin!Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy AU. Very much about healing from trauma, 
trigger warnings for pretty much anything imaginable. Diverges a lot and gets much much 
darker than the originals but does an amazing job worldbuilding pureblood wizarding 
society and magical creatures.
- [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) is a web serial about a superpowered society
and the ramifications thereof. Both cynical and capable of tugging at your heartstrings in just the right way. Very much a product of its time.

# Blogs
- [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/) is a blog about psychiatry and philosophy.
- [Thing of Things](https://thingofthings.com/) is a blog about... Social justice? Sorta?
