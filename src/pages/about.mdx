# About

Hi! Welcome to my not-blog. I write things about esports, tech, and whatever else tickles
my fancy. Opinions are my own. 

# About Me

I'm a math major at the University of Washington, currently helping with the collegiate
esports scene here. I run [WGA Overwatch](https://discord.gg/m4rTxEQ) and I'm on the 
esports team for the [Gaming Association @ UW](https://discord.gg/z5pWGrr). I'm bi, a cat
lover, and a native Seattleite. Currently a Tools Developer for [Tespa](https://tespa.org/).

# Site Philosophy
I had some free time and I wanted to build someplace I could host some writing and 
experiments with minimal fuss. I read [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/About) and make no
secret that this site is inspired by Gwern's thoughts on how to make an effective website.
This site is my take on `gwern.net`, using tools and technologies that I like and that I
think are effective. Read more about that <Link to="/technology/about">here</Link>

# Contact Me
Interested in esports at the university level? Email me at [skye@hyphen-emdash.com](mailto:skye@hyphen-emdash.com)
or message me on Discord at Skyedelaciel#0001. I'd also love to hear about internship
or full-time opportunities either as a developer or in esports.
