<Title> About This Site </Title>
<Abstract>
	Skyedelaciel is intended to be a personal portfolio site, serving mostly essays or
	self-contained experimental applications.
	Its technical goals mostly revolve around being easy to tweak, edit, and release.
	Skyedelaciel was built with <a href="https://github.com/react-static/react-static">react-static</a>, a static site generator built around React.
	It also makes heavy use of the <a href="https://mdxjs.com">MDX</a> plugin for react-static so
	pages can be written in markdown and focus on content instead of scaffolding.
	Styling is done with Semantic UI, since I am Bad at CSS.
</Abstract>

*Epistemic Status*: Certain. Dependent on my knowledge of Web Technologies and code
I've written, both of which don't have a lot of uncertainty.

*Likelyhood of Revisiting*: High, as I'll likely add more features and make changes that
require updating the documentation of them on this page.

# Table of Contents

# Goals
In building this site, I kept five main technical critereon in mind. In rough order of 
importance, they are:

1. Ease of Creating Content

The site should be laid out in a way that makes it easy for me to create, update and 
eventually deploy pages. It should be tailored specifically to me, not the hypothetical
developer in general.

2. Source-file Legible

Even 100 years down the line, when Node is but a footnote in "History of Computer 
Science" textbooks and npm has been relegated to the dustbin of history, the content on 
this site should still be reasonably legible.

3. Speedy, Robust and Lightweight

The site should be quick to load and not demanding of device resources. It should degrade
gracefully where Javascript or other browser features are unavailable. It should still 
render correctly on older browsers, most mobile devices, and screen readers and other
non-traditional ways of browsing the web.

4. Pretty

The site should look good (❁´▽\`❁)*✲ﾟ*.

5. Version Controlled

The site should be amenable to version control. The site's changes and history should
be easily viewable and easy to access.

# Typescript

I use Typescript both because it provides some compile-time error checking to ensure that
silly typos and trivial bugs are caught, but also because I'm familiar with it, and it's
more comfortable for me to use it than to not use it.

# React Static
[React Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static) is a static site generator built around React and its ecosystem. React Static lets me write pages and components in
ways pretty much indistinguishable from a regular React Single-Page Application (SPA),
but provides most of the benefits of a regular static site.

## Why React? 
Why do we want to use React to build our site? To illustrate, let's look at the code for
our home page!

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import { Navbar } from '../components/navbar';


export default React.memo(() => (
    <Container text>
        <Navbar />
        <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
            <h1>
            Welcome to Skyedelaciel
            </h1>
            <p>
            Personal site where I write essays or link to other people's on topics I care about.
            Opinions are my own.
            </p>
        </div>
    </Container>
));
```

I write the index page exactly the same way I would a view in a React SPA. We write our
component as a functional React component, taking advantage of JSX to make it easy to
create the html we need. We can import useful code from both other project files and 
modules from npm and the wider node ecosystem, but we have full flexibility in how 
this page is finally rendered. It'd be easy to remove the Navbar, for example, and 
replace it with something else. 

I can say with confidence that in accordance with
goal 1, this is the most comfortable way for me to create and update pages on this
site. That's not to say that this means React is the best framework, or that these
design patterns are the best ones, but these are the ones that I'm most used to and
that I work fastest with.

## Why React Static?

React Static takes this React Component and renders it before it hits the browser. It
spits out a single html entrypoint that looks something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    ...
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root">
        <div style="outline:none" tabindex="-1" role="group">
            <div class="bodyContent">
                ...
                        <div style="text-align:center">
                            <h1>Welcome to Skyedelaciel</h1>
                            <p>Personal site where I write essays or link to other people&#x27;s on topics I care about. Opinions are my own.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
		...
</body>
</html>
```

(HTML Scaffolding removed for brevity and clarity)

We can see that in contrast to most React SPAs, all of the content of the site is 
available in plain html. No Javascript has to run before the user can see the site
and its content, in accordance with goal 3.

React Static also generates some stuff that looks like this

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
        window.__routeInfo = JSON.parse("...");
</script>
...
<script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/styles.ac1fd06f.js"></script>
<script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/vendors~main.302c4a1d.js"></script>
<script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.889e95d7.js"></script>
```

This javascript hydrates the React application on the page and begins prefetching 
pages that the user could navigate to next. This enables any components that do require
javascript to run, and reduces load times when navigating to other pages.

# MDX
React-Static is great for writing pages and html directly in a way that's simple and 
comfortable to me. But it seems very tedious to write all my content in html.


```
<h1>
	Imagine this.
</h1>
</p>
	Imagine this, but for a 2.5k word essay. That's a lot.
</p>
```

Not only does it add a lot of friction to have to write out all the html by hand, 
it also makes it less legible, in opposition to goal 2. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is a
way to write Markdown that gets transpiled to the same JSX syntax that React uses. With
MDX, our example becomes

```md
# Imagine this
Imagine this, but for a 2.5k word essay. That's a lot.
```

Much better! Markdown is designed for writing text
content and then transpiling to html, and it's again, something I'm familiar and 
comfortable with. It's also much more legible, as even if MDX no longer exists and the
specification is lost, it's much easier to infer the meaning of the document from the 
MDX source.

## React in MDX

MDX also has the benefit of allowing us to use React components in our Markdown. For
example, we have a title component `title.tsx`

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Head } from 'react-static';

import './title.css';

export const Title: React.FC = ({ children }) => (
    <>
        <h1 className="title">{children}</h1>
        <Head>
        	<title> {children.toString()} - Skyedelaciel </title>
            <meta property="og:title" content={children.toString()} />
        </Head>
    </>
);
```

We use this React component to declare and style the titles for our pages. MDX lets us
use this component in our Markdown to achieve the same effect.

```mdx
import { Title } from '../components/title/title';

<Title> Imagine this </Title>
Imagine this, but for a 2.5k word essay. That's a lot.
```

Not only is this convenient and declarative, but it's also semantic and legible. 
"Imagine this" is pretty clearly the title, and in the output, it will be
styled as such, and we can do the same thing on any page that requires a title.

This configuration is basically "[The Best of Both Worlds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVjRe8QXFHY)"
We get the nice syntax of Markdown with all the flexibility of React.[^1]

[^1]: Under the hood, MDX uses [remark](https://remark.js.org/) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype), both part of the [unified.js collective](https://unifiedjs.com/) to transpile markdown to JSX. This lets us also take advantage of the broad ecosystem of plugins around these tools to provide stuff like [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/mapbox/rehype-prism) or [latex blocks](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/master/packages/remark-math).

# Semantic UI
Semantic UI tries to express design
concepts using natural language. Instead of describing how an element should look,
instead we describe what it is. As an example, let's look at the code for our Navbar.

```tsx
import { Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import * as React from 'react';
import { Link } from '@reach/router';

const Navbar : React.FC = React.memo(() => (
	<Menu stackable text>
        <Menu.Item header link>
            <Link to="/"> Skyedelaciel </Link>
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item link>
            <Link to="/personal"> Personal </Link>
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item link>
            <Link to="/esports"> Esports </Link>
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item link>
            <Link to="/technology"> Technology </Link>
        </Menu.Item>
        <Menu.Item link>
            <Link to="/about"> About </Link>
        </Menu.Item>
        ...
    </Menu>
```

(Again, parts removed for brevity and clarity)

Under Semantic UI, the we describe element-nouns with modifier adjectives, the way
we do in english. What is the element? a `Menu`. What kind of menu is it? one that is
`stackable` and holds `text`. What is in the menu? It's `Menu.Item`, which are `link`s.
One of the `Item`s is also a `header`. This is both very legible and Semantic. Even 
without the existence of the UI Framework, it's mostly obvious what relation the 
content has to each other. It's very simple to create UI elements, which is a 
good thing because I am Bad at CSS and also Not a Designer. It's also reasonably
pretty, and definitely easy to read, fulfilling goal 4.

We use the [Fomantic UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/) stylesheets and 
[Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/). Fomantic UI is a community fork of
Semantic UI[^2], and Semantic UI React just adds handy React components that translate 
into Semantic UI elements.

[^2]: The original maintainer of Semantic UI ended up unable to actively maintain the project [due to work commitments](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6109#issuecomment-361104864) (Honestly the most valid). Fomantic UI is a community fork to continue development, with the intention of being merged back into Semantic UI at a later date. 

# Devops

There's a robust set of devops tools in place to make building and deploying the site
as easy as possible. The infastructure mostly follows [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) 
principles, but not perfectly. In essence, all I have to do to update the live site
is to add a commit to the appropriate branch, reducing friction as much as possible 
in accordance with goal 1. 

## CircleCI
I use CircleCI to provide CI and CD. As far as configurations go, it's pretty simple.
I first build a production build of the site with React Static. I then put the built
site into a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) image that serves it with [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).
I tag the docker image with both the git commit hash and the branch it's on and then push
that image and both tags to my private docker repository instance at `repository.hyphen-emdash.com`.

## Deploy
Under the `promote` branch lives a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
configuration that defines a `master`, `staging`, and `cursed` instance of skyedelaciel,
corresponding to the branches `master`, `staging` and `cursed`. A local version of this 
branch is stored on hyphen-emdash.com. On commits to `staging`, `promote`, `cursed`, and 
`master`, in addition to building and tagging the regular image, I define another task 
to ssh into `hyphen-emdash.com`[^3] and both update the local repository and pull and run
the latest versions of the `master`, `staging`, and `cursed` images.


[^3]: I realize that I'm giving out a lot of details about my probably very vulnerable personal server, and if I get hacked it will only be my own fault. If you are a console cowboy surfing the reaches of cyberspace and notice anything vulnerable about anything on `hyphen-emdash.com`, please drop me a note at [skye@hyphen-emdash.com](mailto:skye@hyphen-emdash.com) so I can fix it. Or hack my server and use it to impersonate me and mine bitcoin (please don't actually do that).

## Serving
The docker images serve the site, but do so indiscriminately and without HTTPS, a big 
no-no. `hyphen-emdash` runs [docker-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) and
[docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) to provide routing and HTTPS to all the other
microservices living on [hyphen-emdash.com](https://hyphen-emdash.com/).
In the `docker-compose.yml` that is part of `promote`, we set the environment variables 
that docker-proxy needs to work its magic and then we're done! We serve the production 
instance at [skyedelaciel.hyphen-emdash.com](https://skyedelaciel.hyphen-emdash.com), 
and do so similarly with our `cursed` and  `staging` branches. `docker-proxy` routes 
requests automagically based on the HTTP host header, and 
`docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion` talks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to automagically generate and serve a certificate for the site.
