<Title> TODO list </Title>

<Abstract> Here's a bunch of things that are either broken or that I think need improving. </Abstract>

# Things which are broken
- Nothing right now!

# Things which are not optimal
- Index templating.
    - The index pages for each topic are just giant blobs of JSX right now; I should
    probably figure out how to pull out the commonalities and have the content 
    separated from the scaffolding.
- Semantic UI
    - Currently a decent number of content pages directly use Semantic UI components
    which makes me completely dependent on them; I'd prefer to be able to move to another
    UI framework transparently, which means I really should add a translation layer
    between the Semantic UI components and my own content.
- Page load sizes
    - The base entrypoint for the site is around 350kb, not counting external fonts and
    stylesheets. Semantic UI in particular is a chonky boi, at around 500kb for the base
    sheet. The CDN helps with cache, but it does still mean a thicc first page load, 
    which I should look into optimizing. Not sure how to do so without ditching Semantic 
    UI, but that option isn't off the table.
- Anchor links
    - The anchor links on each heading work correctly, but they show up and are non-
    functional when javascript is disabled, which might be confusing to anyone who has
    javascript disabled.
- Git Integration
    - Currently [git-revision-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-revision-webpack-plugin) provides a level of git integration to
    Skyedelaciel, but it's limited in it's scope and I'd like to take it out
    and homebrew something that does everything I want it to
        - I'd like to automatically generate changelogs based on git commits to master
        - I'd also like pages to be able to check their own git history to give 
        information about when they were created and updated. 

# Things which do not exist but should
- Sidenotes
    - [Tufte-style sidenotes](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#sidenotes) are
    a cool way to do footnotes. I love footnotes[^ it's true], but traditional footnotes 
    have horrible web UX: they're fiddly to check and then you lose your place in the
    page when you finish reading and try to go back.
    - Sidenotes are *really* hard to implement though, because they don't really make 
    sense from a web perspective. Sidenotes are sort of like... Floating side bits that 
    make a best effort to link up with a specific text anchor; not something that's easy
    to implement.
        - That's not even getting into the fallback modes when margins aren't available.
    - No one really has written a component to do all that stuff[^2], probably
    for the reasons described.
            - The approach I had in mind looks like [John D Jameson's approach](https://johndjameson.com/blog/responsive-sidenotes/) There are technical caveats though.
- Navbar
    - The navbar right now is nice, but I kind of wish it could be better. It's kind
    of unbalanced when vertically stacked on narrow screens. I'd like for
    the navbar to use the left margin space (going forward, left margin is for site
    things, right margin is for sidenotes), but I don't have a good UX for when it needs
    to shift out of the left margin in narrow screens.
- Link Previews
    - I'd like to have popups on hover over links to get a preview of what the link goes
    to, or for excerpts and citations on things I'm citing. The most straightforward but
    annoying things to implement, there should be an easy component for this but there
    isn't[^ Everything else is usually too bloated and big and fancy.]. Just gonna have
    to spend an afternoon on it sometime.
        - A test version is up and running! Unfortunately it does not like Server-Side
        Rendering because Promises. Need to figure out how to tell react-static to
        ignore it during the render process or to pre-fetch some data synchronously.
- Linting
    - It's a well known fact that math gays can't spell. It'd be nice to have a linter
    that can catch both stylistic atrocities in the source code as well as dumb spelling 
    misteaks in the content. It should hit the sweet spot where it catches my mistakes 
    but doesn't require me to fight it to get it to pass linting checks.
- The content
    - I have categories but not actual articles for most things on this site.
    Not a good look.
- Dark mode
    - I'd like to switch between dark and light theme files using [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) and
    associated media queries. I'm thinking flatly for light and darkly for dark.

[^2]: Okay, technically not true, some guy at Full Stack University made a [sidenotes implementation](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/hackathon-presentations/sidenotes) for 
react during a hackathon but it's *NOT ON NPM* and *I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE*
